                            <a  href="Joy_division.html">Joy Division</a> were an English rock band from the Greater Manchester area. Formed in 1976, the band released two studio albums; Unknown Pleasures (1979) and Closer (1980) before lead singer, Ian Curtis, committed suicide in May 1980, aged 23.

                            Despite their brief existence, Joy Division exerted far reaching influence on the alternative rock genre throughout the world. They soon developed a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk and gothic rock movements.
